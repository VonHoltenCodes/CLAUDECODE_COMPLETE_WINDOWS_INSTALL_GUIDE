   - ❌ Cannot run Windows .exe files directly
   - ❌ Cannot change system settings

4. **Development Environment Limitations**
   - ❌ No C/C++ compilers by default
   - ❌ Cannot install global npm packages in restricted directories
   - ❌ Cannot modify system-wide configurations
   - ❌ Limited package installation in system directories

## 🔄 Capability Comparison by Launch Location

| Capability | From System32 | From User Directory |
|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| File editing | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Full |
| Git operations | ❌ Fails | ✅ Works |
| Create projects | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Install packages | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Run scripts | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Full |
| Access other folders | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

## 💡 Maximizing Claude Code's Potential

### Best Launch Locations
1. `C:\Users\[YourName]\Documents\Projects`
2. `C:\Development`
3. `D:\Work` (or any non-system drive)
4. Any user-created directory

### Optimal Workflows

#### For Web Development
```bash
cd C:\Users\traxx\Documents\WebProjects
wsl claude
# Now you can:
# - Create React/Vue/Angular apps
# - Run development servers
# - Install npm packages
# - Use git freely
```

#### For Python Development  
```bash
cd C:\Users\traxx\Documents\PythonProjects
wsl claude
# Now you can:
# - Create virtual environments
# - Install pip packages
# - Run Python scripts
# - Use git for version control
```

#### For General Scripting
```bash
cd C:\Users\traxx\Documents\Scripts
wsl claude
# Now you can:
# - Create automation scripts
# - Process data files
# - Build utilities
# - Organize your tools
```

## 🚀 Unleashing Full Power

### When Launched Properly, Claude Code Can:

1. **Build Complete Applications**
   - Full-stack web apps
   - CLI tools
   - Data processing pipelines
   - Automation scripts

2. **Manage Projects**
   - Initialize git repositories
   - Create proper project structures
   - Set up CI/CD configurations
   - Manage dependencies

3. **Integrate with Development Tools**
   - Work alongside VS Code
   - Integrate with Docker (if installed in WSL)
   - Use build tools (webpack, gulp, etc.)
   - Run test suites

4. **Handle Complex Tasks**
   - Refactor large codebases
   - Analyze performance issues
   - Generate comprehensive documentation
   - Create and run test suites

## 📋 Summary

Claude Code is extremely capable when launched from appropriate directories. The limitations you might experience are primarily due to security restrictions when launched from system directories. 

**Golden Rule**: Launch Claude Code from your project or user directories to unlock its full potential!

### Quick Test
To see the difference, try:
```bash
# Limited capabilities:
cd C:\Windows\system32 && wsl claude

# vs

# Full capabilities:
cd C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents && wsl claude
```

The second option gives you access to all of Claude Code's powerful features!
